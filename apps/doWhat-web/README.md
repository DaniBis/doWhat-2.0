## doWhat Web

The canonical documentation for the web app lives in the repo root (`README.md`) and in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`. This file exists only as a breadcrumb for developers who open the `apps/doWhat-web` folder directly.

- Run the web dev server with `pnpm --filter dowhat-web dev` from the repo root.
- Review environment variables in `README.md` → *Environment variables*.
- For architecture details, roadmap, and troubleshooting, see:
	- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
	- `ROADMAP.md`
	- `changes_log.md` / `error_log.md`

If you landed here from an editor workspace, jump to the repo root for the full documentation set.
